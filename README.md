- 👋 Hi, I’m @DaniDeer
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT and IIoT, Digital Transformation and 3D printing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how NOT to digitally transform as a large manufacturing company... and still make important contributions in such an environment as a small team.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IoT/IIoT projects and edge computing.
- 📫 To get in contact, write me an email to danirocks@hotmail.de.
